Below mentioned programs are a part of an assignment series for my Operating Systems (COMP 322) class.


Assignment01DM - Process Creation Hierarchy

This program simulates process creation and destruction using a hierarchical structure. Each process is represented by a Process Control Block (PCB), containing information about its parent, first child, older sibling, and younger sibling.

Assignment02DM - Batch Process Scheduling

This program implements batch scheduling algorithms to schedule processes in a computer system. It provides functionalities to enter parameters for processes, schedule processes using different algorithms such as FIFO (First In First Out), SJF (Shortest Job First), and SRT (Shortest Remaining Time), and quit the program.
